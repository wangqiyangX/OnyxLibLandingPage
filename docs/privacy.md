## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

## Data Retention

- **iCloud Data**: If you use iCloud sync, your data will be retained according to your iCloud account settings.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## International Data Transfers

If you use iCloud sync, your data may be transferred to and stored on servers located outside your country of residence. These transfers are governed by Apple's data transfer policies.
